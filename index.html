                            Setting up Github was kind of intimidating because as time has been going all these websites or apps are becoming more and more complex to use as a person starting off using the softwares it is as if a punishment as to why one has not been using the software or site and get the 'OG' users talk about certain annoying features and tricks not known by new people, but overall me setting up Github was much easier than I had initially thought it would be, it is a cool software that does wonders as one can be able to save work without having to be worried that one day their device might get ruined and not be able to recover the hard work made, and it allows for much easier backtracking when you want to fix an issue you make without having to delete other work you made before by just going to the part where you made the mistake. Overall the little time spent learning how to use Github I am impressed by things that can be achieved and how it helps one work much more efficiently alone and/or with a group big thumbs up :).

                            The reading I engaged on this week is by Wardrip-Fruin "What Hypertext Is", initially my first thought reading through this was that, how can people have arguments about what hypertexts are till I managed to get how the confusion comes about. I do have to agree with Nelsons explanation of hypertexts as actually to a average user and non-designer point of view it is just like an interactive form of media but in a form of words that lead you on to different parts of texts that one may desire to look at, at that time, before having a look on this reading I initially understood hypertexts on a basic level of like sort of button one clicks that helps you links to certain sites or texts to make understanding much easier and get to your desired destination of the site much quicker than having to read everything on the page.

                            I didnt think that far with the course as I had no idea prior to doing the course what it was about, so currently going with the flow and loving the fact I will be making websites using HTML CSS and Javascript, I've always wanted to learn these languages to expand my exposure in coding and programming, feeling great about this looking forward to creating websites and application. </p>

                            Starting of the year with a new challenge at hand after a very crazy period learning about C++ and C#, having to start off learning about HTML bought me all the struggles and nightmare I had when learning a new coding language. To say I am totally unfamiliar with  HTML would be incorrect as in the last month I have engaged with a video that teaches beginners HTML and CSS but was doing it for fun and just developed an interest in just being able to make a website myself for a gaming clan in PubG Mobile. As I was learning the basic fundamentals of HTML and CSS I quickly realized how actually easy it is to understand as compared to the other languages I have covered in the last year it more of  English language structure and to do certain tasks like for example writing a line of text or paragraph being able to just use the p tag followed by text  which is the easiest of the two languages I have learnt to date. Overall I am very excited and like HTML and CSS because of how easy it is to apply very easy languages to learn.

                            The reading by  Lawson, Bruce. “Why You Should Choose HTML5.” is a little confusing to me about why to use article over section as to me they appear to be the same thing and think that perhaps as you are building the website you could use and of the two and just make sure any of the two give you the best result you need and having to fix here and there to get the desired outcome, but having seen there are screen readers that happen to bump into some difficulties distinguishing when a summary for example the use of both to me looks like they their own benefits as sections can be used to properly and clearly separate extra of additional text from each other and articles being used to separate paragraphs and heads from main text. At this moment I am very confused between their difference I would like to see the differences they make through testing by building sites using both.</p>

                            This week I learnt about CSS styling of websites and how it is done, learnt that for styling of the website it is possible to style the website on the HTML file but then it is not recommended as it will dirty up the HTML  which is not ideal at all, I found it nice and pretty straight forward but with potential of being tricky as you may want to style a number of things on the web page and will require you to specify exactly what you are targeting to style  and can lead to a whole lot of code written to style and can create mistakes as you style more and more, I never thought this is how one styles their websites initially I thought maybe everything is draw  on a app then it is taken as a picture or animation then put on top of buttons, but also CSS makes it possible to create high quality buttons and texts.

                            The reading on Convention and Context, the video about bad doors and the lecture about interactions link up perfectly into my understanding of user interface (UI) and user experience (UX), the one that interests me the most is the bad doors video as for example why would one need to have a handle on a door that is meant to be pushed without having just a flat surface which would automatically tell the person to push the door as there is no other way to interact with the door. I have ran through many of there situations while using websites that some features in the website could have been made easier than they needed to have been but and thus causing one to be annoyed of the website because it ends up being a time waster unintentionally, thus the User Experience being bad and not exciting at all thus most times design must be fairly simple and straight forward and not try make something more confusing in order to make it look like something else, just because its a door does not mean it has to have handles on both sides , the design must be made to suit its function other than conventions known of doors to have handles, the UI design must suit the end goal and make it easier to see what to do way before you attempt to do something which will in return yield a great user experience.</p>

                            The first reading I engaged on is the basic principles of user interface design which interested me the most of all the reading this far as lately I have noticed how frustrating it is to use some websites and apps that when I need to perform a particular action I quickly get irritated with the interface as it has too many steps to undertake in order to perform a task I intend to do, as stated simplicity and having to perform as little of clicks as possible would be really handy and very vital in capturing the interest of users, being minimal too with information, the shorter the better I find much more fun and nicer with less information to process. What really stuck to me is the use of certain images like bell icons and so on that there is a certain expectation with certain icons that must be kept with the knowledge gained from using other sites and apps and must be kept as know by the majority which I totally agree on. 
                            
                             <span class="span-span">How do my wireframes hold up against the reading and lectures on UI, </span> 
                            
                            My initial wireframes had different uses for certain icons which in general mean another thing, so I had to change up how they are used and the functions they have, the wireframes were a bit clustered and as I am reading on the principles of design, I bumped on the point where simplicity is key and is way better than anything complicated requires less thinking and analyses from the user to easily browse through and find exactly what they want quick taking into account that this is a portfolio website the user is mostly interested to see my capabilities with the website rather than the content and if they easily use the website to find everything they want to find out, therefore currently that is my main focus making it easier to navigate through the website.

                            As I am wrapping up my website, I have had plenty of fun and struggles to get to the end of the website, I have had tonnes of fun in seeing the website fall into place one code at a time and every save made and having to see the website become something I had initially planned with few changes from the original thought of how it will look,  the struggles of certain looks I wanted to execute on the website but could not pull them off forcing me to leave them off and change to different looks.

                            <span class="span-span">Goal Alignment -</span>  My goal with the website is to make a website that is not frustrating to use that has thousands of links to get to certain sections or read what the user need to read, thus making a very simple minimal click website with access to everything in the website very simply, since my user will be a teacher wanting to see my work on the website and my content I have to make sure that it is easy to read my work and understand without any problems.
                            
                            <span class="span-span">User Flow -</span>  I have not looked at this directly as in focus on it solely but have thought about how I will structure my content in terms of simple logical fashion that the user wants to see my work first decide whether they like it or not then will head to my about section to find out me about me if they are interested in me then finally reach conclusion to head to my contact section if they would like to work with me.
                            
                            <span class="span-span">Interface Elements -</span>  I have included Input controls but minimal and also Nav components, the information components not as much as the website is straight forward and nothing complicated that need explanations on what to do it is pretty much scroll and read and is very minimal on physical user interaction it is mostly visual. 
                            
                            Overall the process of making the website is going great and is shaping up well currently enjoying the process and sleepless nights.</p>

                <h2>Goal Alignment</h2>
                <p>The goals with the website is to design something easy to use and easy to read through and get what is needed from the website with ease. I want the user to see a simple byt also attractive website in the design part of it and be interested to read the content in the website. My user is my lecturer and the lecturer is on the website to access my understanding of work taught in class and my abilities to use what has been taught in class to create high quality websites and content and assess me accordingly. The content that will be in the website will be related to my time spent learning new skills of web developing and how to make websites that are better than every other website similar to mine and represents me accordingly, and show cases my talent that have developed as I keep engaging more and more with the work of making websites.</p>
                <h2 class="styleHead">User Flow</h2>
                <p>The user flow I chose is that the user firstly sees my homepage which is first impression based which will try get the users attention to be interested in my website, followed by weekly blogs to see my day in life weekly as a web developer, what do I do to enhance my skill what I read to further improve myself. Thirdly I want the user to go look at the design of my website and see what was going on in my head in the design of the website what made me choose certain things for the website and show them how I ended up choosing these and how they started off as ideas, this will be followed by an essay section summarizing the the whole process of making the website and how it went. Then will go ahead have a portfolio section in order to show the user what services I can offer and what projects I have done previously to see maybe I can be of use to them and they can see if they need any of the similar work to be done for them. Then lastly this will be my profile and contacts section, reason why I linked them together is that since now I will be talking about myself here they will first get to know me and see if they would like to work with me or not if they do like the person I am work wise they just one small scroll away to getting all my contact details down below and be able to view my resume on a separate page. </p>
                <h2 class="styleHead">Interface Elements</h2>
                <p>The interface elements used are Input Controls which are in form buttons which allow for quick navigation across the website and not much of these as I believe the user is just here to read content and not input anything to the website. The navigation components are also in terms or buttons and for smaller screens I have included the addition of hamburger icon on the top right corner in order for the user to access the quick nav buttons. The information component was not significant for this website as the website is simple as it is sort of a resume content listed in the website are self explanatory with nothing needing special knowledge or education.</p>

            <h2>Aesthetics and Goals</h2>
            <p>The Aesthetics I personally was looking for was black and white with a touch of green to give a feeling of freshness and purity in the design. The design was intended that when looking at it, it is calming and simple with a bunch of white space to resemble purity touches of black and green to resemble healthy and calming simplicity</p>  
            
            <h2 class="styleHead">Fonts</h2>
            <p>The font style chosen here is named Inter which I chose as my main font because it gives me taste of the posters seen in "Wanted Persons" posters as they are in black and white and letters having block like writing on them and is super easy and eye easy to read as the spacing between letters is perfect and constant thus making reading words that much more easier as they are all in line </p>

            <h2 class="styleHead">Headers</h2>
            <p>I decided to add a header and footer in my website, firstly the header I added it such that it can house all the links to different sections in my website then decided that instead of having a scroller button on the right hand side to go to different sections of the website I make the header always visible to the user and that whenever a user wants to quickly jump to different sections of my website they can do so with easy by clicking on the links on the header. The footer was mainly made for appearance that at the end of the website there is a proper and nice looking ending that is appealing and can also house links to different social media sites provide contact details and provide necessary links to connect with me</p> 
    
            <h2 class="styleHead">layout Choice</h2>
            <p>The layout of the design style I decided on using was a layout of containing items in their own boxes allowing for more neatness in the website and allowing for easier transitions between all the contents being displayed without any hustle. I tried to be minimalistic about different layout styles being used and use one as i believe using multiple layout styles can result in a very unpleasant looking website as consistent layout structure the user before going to the next section of the page has an idea of how the section is supposed to look and if that section uses a different layout style it will bring up frustration and making the user annoyed about the design </p>

            </div>

            <div class="style-guideee">
                <p>The UI and UX I was trying to implement was easy thus did not have big impact and make things hard as the goals I had were based on being minimalistic and appealing in the eyes of the user, thus the CSS file was pretty much straight forward and easy to deal with with a few difficulties when it got to making grids and boxes to house my pictures and putting text right next to the pictures, and the HTML side is straight forward without any complications to the overall structure of the HTML file and the use of Javascript was minimal as the UI and UX I was aiming for did not require much use if javascript.</p>
                <h2 class="styleHead">Semantic Markup</h2>
                <p>The semantic markup used communicates with browser and provides sufficient context, the interface elements are expressed appropriately in the website they are proper and not confusing and consistent, the style in which the content is being expressed on the website is in proper order and expressed fully and correctly accessibility could be improved for mobile users as the burger menu is no longer functioning as it used to anymore with glitches.</p>
                <h2 class="styleHead">Javascript</h2>
                <p>I express some interaction points using JavaScript such as when in mobile screen sizes there is a burger icon that has all the links to different sections of the website which closes on its own in a animation once a link is pressed, this is done through DOM manipulation</p>
                <h2 class="styleHead">CSS</h2>
                <p>The use of CSS was to style my website separately without messing with the HTML file, this was used from making boxes, changing colors all the way to changing font sizes to create more consistent styling throughout the website as best as possible. This CSS file is linked to the HTML file.</p>
